Set up NTP to manage system time

Ceph relies on loosely synchronized clocks. DeepSea will by default start an
NTP client on each cluster node and point it to the NTP server running on the
Salt Master if and only if the ntpd.service systemd unit is not running.

If you want DeepSea to always overwrite an existing NTP configuration set
"time_init: ntp" in the pillar.

To disable all NTP management set "time_init: disabled" in the pillar. Note
that the admin should have some form of time synchronisation set up in this
case, otherwise Ceph might not function reliably.
