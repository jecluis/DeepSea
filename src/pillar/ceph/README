== Default Configuration

The Salt pillar is a key-value store.  The file format is yaml.  Most of the
configuration is generated automatically by Stages 1 and 2.  Stage 2 places the
results under stack/default in a hierarchy.  

== Custom Configuration

A separate hierarchy allows the admin to override all settings.  The hierarchy
is 

stack/global.yml
stack/ceph/cluster.yml
stack/ceph/roles/{{role}}.yml
stack/ceph/minions/{{minion}}.yml

DeepSea currently supports one Ceph cluster, so the cluster.yml is redundant
with the global.yml.  The role and minion files allow setting of pillar
variables that are only available to the intended minions.  These are rarely
used.  When in doubt about the placement of variables, use the global.yml.

For examples of contents, see /usr/share/doc/packages/deepsea/pillar/.

== An Example

The default time server is set to the Salt master.  This setting is configured
in stack/default/global.yml.  To override, add the following to
stack/global.yml:

time_server: my_ntp_server

Note that the stack/default/global.yml is not changed.  To apply the change to
Salt, run

salt '*' saltutil.pillar_refresh

To view the change

salt '*' pillar.items

Notice that the time_server will have your setting.  This same strategy can be
applied to any customizations.  Normally, an admin makes the change and reruns
Stage 2 which calls the refresh as well.

== Custom Roles

Should you decide to use the custom roles for RadosGW or Ganesha, be sure to
run Stage 1 after updating the pillar.  This is an exception until we
reorganize some of the steps between Stage 1 and Stage 2.
